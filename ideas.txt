Text File for keeping track of ideas for how we will build our project.

Solitaire
3 layers 
- Data storage/communication
- user inferface
- game engine itself

First thing you see is a login for the user. 
 - User can either update the back-side of cards ( each face card will have its own face image,
     with a default face image like a standard king, joker, etc.), 
     or play the user can just play the game.
 In playing the actual game...
  - 4 slots at top for building Ace card and up, 1 to the top right for the loose deck. 
  - 7 slots across for putting card stacks together.
  - The loose deck will allow (maybe) that the user plays with klondike or solitaire. 
There are 4 suits and 2 colors to the deck:
 - Obviously, those colors and the suit will be reflected on each card.
 - Graphically, the upper 1/3 of the card will be:
      --- In the top left, the number of the card (of face value)
      --- In the top right, the suite in the appropriate color
      --- The bottom 2/3 is either, the scaled suit icon or the saved face image selected/saved by the user.
