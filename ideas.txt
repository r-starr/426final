Text File for keeping track of ideas for how we will build our project.

|-----------------------------------------------------------|
GamerWorlde

3 layers 
- Data storage (relational tables and such)
- communication 
- user inferface/login (ie. connect to server)

Login Page (.../login)
   - input username/email (should we pick one to make it easier on us?)
      - should this field autocomplete? (pretty sure it was one of the requirements, be careful with security of it because a TA mentioned it)
      - some way to validate the information to see if an account with the username/password exists
   - login page --> main page of the website
   - create account --> create account page

Create Account Page (.../newaccount)
   - Take in the information (name, last name, email, password [am i missing anything?])
      - find some arbitrary data to add because KMP said so ("this is what the backend stores by default in account.json")
   - creates an account
      - we dont need a verification thing (too much, fuck it)
   - routes them to login page

Home page (.../main)
   - looks a bit like the twich homepage with a grid of the most popular games (or only lol)
      - should users be able to add pictures to the games?
   - below the grid is a feed from other users (their reviews and such, like twitter)
      - user should be able to create, update, and delete them (requirement)
      - review
         - text of the acutal review
         - game it's connected to
         - rating (numerical value represented by stars/whatever graphic we decide on)
         - tags???
         - date review was made (should be displayed on the review card)
         - user who created it
         - other info??
      - game
         - name
         - developer
         - year released
         - link reviews (an array? database stuff)
         - user who created it
         - other info??
   - on the left is a profile card
      - displays basic info and all that
   - User can create new "review" and input information (ie. title, developer, thoughts, rating[categorical])
      - categories: soundtrack, graphics, story, overall
      - can also create a new game (check to make sure duplicates aren't created via checking the string title)
      - will rating be filling in stars? (that'd be sorta cool but how hard would it be?)
   - users will be able to edit and delete and make new reviews
      - on the main page (like twitter, will this be problematic???)

UI
   - vibes
      - pixel art (ex. stars for likes)
      - retro pixel art banners
      - each review would look like ...?
   - requirements
      - dynamic data source to generate content (do not hardcode it all)
      - consume a 3rd party API??? (still not sure what this means)
      - how does it look and behave?
         - is it pretty?
         - is the use intuitive?
         - "in particular, it should provide a pleasant user experience and demonstrate good design fundamentals"
   - include some things that were EC on twittter?
      - infinite scrolling, selectively see reviews (should you be able to reply to a review?)

Profile (.../profile)
   - do we want the ability to add profile pictures?
      - where would be store it? (user's computer?)
   - all of the user's reviews/games they've created
      - able to separate them
   - other features for profile?
   - multiple sort (author, personal ranking, alphabetical by title)
   - should the user be able to have cool settings?
      - dark mode, change email/password, etc?

In Summary
Login page: login/create
Main page: grid, feed, profile (on the left)
   - ability to create content here
Profile page: content created by that personal
   - sorting own reviews?
