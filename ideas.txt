Goodreads 2.0

Solitaire
3 layers 
- Data storage (relational tables and such)
- communication 
- user inferface/login (ie. connect to server)

First thing you see is a login for the user. (or create an account if they want)
 - User can create new "books" and input information (ie. title, authors, publishers, thoughts, rating)
 - In the actual website
    - there will be a feed (much like twitter) where they can see the activity of all other users
    - users will be able to look at their own profile and their books and such
 - users will be able to edit and delete and make new books
 - users can have custom shelves (categories)
 - multiple sort (author, personal ranking, alphabetical by title)
