Text File for keeping track of ideas for how we will build our project.

GamerWorlde

3 layers 
- Data storage (relational tables and such)
- communication 
- user inferface/login (ie. connect to server)

First thing you see is a login for the user. (or create an account if they want)
 - User can create new "review" and input information (ie. title, developer, thoughts, rating[categorical])
    - categories: soundtrack, graphics, story, overall
 - In the actual website
    - there will be a feed (much like twitter) where they can see the activity of all other users
    - users will be able to look at their own profile and their reviews and such
 - users will be able to edit and delete and make new reviews
 - multiple sort (author, personal ranking, alphabetical by title)
 - UI vibes
    - pixel art (ex. stars for likes)
    - retro pixel art banners
    - each review would look
